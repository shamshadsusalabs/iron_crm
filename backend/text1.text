"<p><strong>Sputnikmusic</strong> is an American music community website offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_journalism">music criticism</a> and music news alongside features commonly associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a>-style websites. The format of the website is unusual in that it includes both professional and amateur content, distinguishing it from professionally written music websites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)"><i>Pitchfork</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Mix_Tapes"><i>Tiny Mix Tapes</i></a>, as well as collecting and presenting a wiki-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> database in a manner comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_Your_Music">Rate Your Music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discogs">Discogs</a>.</p><p>Over time, the site came to be established as a credible source; it is now among the sources that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a> uses to compile "Critic Scores" and is used as a news source by other websites.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Music#cite_note-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Music#cite_note-2">[2]</a> As a general rule, the staff writers tended to focus on new releases; however, any user was welcome to submit a review of any album that has been officially released. All genres of music were covered by the site, with dedicated subsections for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music">metal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_music">punk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_(music)">indie</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music">rock</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music">hip hop</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music">pop</a>; an 'Other' section also caters to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music">electronica</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_hop">trip hop</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music">classical music</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack">soundtracks</a></p>"
